# Vehicle_Routing
This repository was created from using the code: https://github.com/MUSoC/Visualization-of-popular-algorithms-in-Python/tree/master/Travelling%20Salesman%20Problem. The aim of the project was to determine the best route for our drivers to use when delivering merchandise to our clients. It was pretty effective.
